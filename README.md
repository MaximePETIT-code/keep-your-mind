# Keep your mind

Keep your mind is a false association to fight against the Mads company, imagined in a design fiction project. Mads has a product called Neura that aims to donate his brain power to big business in exchange for income.

This site then brought together video testimonials on the harmful effects of the product. I had a creative approach to the make the design and development of this site in a very short time.
